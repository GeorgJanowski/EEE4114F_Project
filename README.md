EEE4114F Project: Linear Channel Equalisation

This repo contains Matlab scripts that were used in a DSP project on linear channel equalisation.
The basic idea was to get a Zero Forcing (ZF equaliser and a Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equaliser working.
The MMSE equaliser uses a LMS algorithm. I looked at initialising the weights of this algorithm to get it to converge faster.
