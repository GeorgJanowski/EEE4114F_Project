EEE4114F Project: Linear Channel Equalisation

This repo contains Matlab scripts that were used in a DSP project on linear channel equalisation.
The basic idea was to get a Zero Forcing (ZF) equaliser and a Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equaliser (using LMS) working.
And then to see if initialising the weights of the LMS algorithm with the ZF impulse response would get it to converge faster.
